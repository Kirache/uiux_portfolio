                    <h1>Redesign Process</h1>

                    <p>My friends and I are avid readers of manhwa, or Korean comics. One website we use often is MANHWATOP, so I
                    decided to try to improve and redesign their manhwa page.</p>

                    <p>Specifically, I am using the manhwa page of "Survive as the Hero's Wife," although all manhwa pages
                        on the site are formatted the same.</p>

                    <p class="description"><a href="https://manhwatop.com/manga/survive-as-the-heros-wife">https://manhwatop.com/manga/survive-as-the-heros-wife</a></p>

                    <h1>Usability Problems</h1>

                    <p>To determine how to improve the website, I first had to identify problems to fix.
                    </p>

                    <p>I identified usability, learnability, memorability and efficiency problems based on
                        my analysis and previous complaints from friends. Here is a summary of some problems : </p>

                    <br><br>

                    <div class="blue-box">
                        Additional Problems :
                        <ul>
                            <li>“REQUEST?” menu option name is unclear</li>

                            <li>The menu bar that pops up when you scroll up blocks content and irritates many users, as this is an
                                information page people often scroll back and forth on</li>

                            <li>After clicking on “Show More” on chapters it becomes tedious to return to the top of the page with 100+ chapters in the way</li>

                            <li>“BLOG” leads you to a page displaying suggested or new manhwa, and not to a blog</li>

                            <li>There are 3 different recommendation sections on the page, which is a bit much and distracts from
                                the information about the manhwa the page is focused on</li>

                            <li>The “YOU MAY ALSO LIKE” section is important but is placed at the very bottom where it is hard to find</li>

                            <li>A very large amount of comments are shown before "Load more comments" option, making it difficult to reach the bottom of the page.
                                 (This not apparent on this specific manhwa's page as there are not many comments, but is an issue when there are). There is also no
                                 way to show less comments after pressing "load more comments," making it difficult to reach the top of the page.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <br><br>

                    <h2>Accessibility</h2>
                    <p>I assessed accessibility with the help of WebAIM WAVE and VoiceOver.</p>
                    <p>A large portion of the website is light grey text on light grey or white background, causing a lot of contrast errors.
                        WAVE detected 155 contrast errors. WAVE also found 7 elements that were missing alternative text describing them,
                        making it difficult for users using screen readers to determine their functions. When testing the website with VoiceOver
                        on Safari, I struggled with the navigation bar because there are dropdown options under “MANGA LIST” and “BLOG,” but
                        this was not announced to me so I have no way of knowing they exist and cannot navigate to them without moving my mouse
                        cursor to them.</p>
                </div>

                <!-- Visual Redesign -->
                <div class="section">
                    <h1>Visual Redesign</h1>

                    <!-- Lofi -->
                    <h2>Low-Fidelity Wireframing</h2>
                    <p>I first redesigned the page visually by making a set of low-fidelity wireframes for desktop, tablet, and mobile using Basalmiq.</p>

                    <p class="description">Desktop</p>
                    <img src="./images/lowfi-desktop.png" alt="Low Fidelity Desktop Wireframe">

                    <div class="split-box">
                        <div class="column">
                            <p class="description">Tablet</p>
                            <img class="half" src="./images/lowfi-tablet.png" alt="Low Fidelity Tablet Wireframe">
                        </div>

                        <div class="column">
                            <p class="description">Mobile</p>
                            <img class="half" src="./images/lowfi-mobile.png" alt="Low Fidelity Mobile Wireframe">
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <p>I chose to include a flag to show if the story is a manga, manhua, or manhwa instead of writing it out, because the words are very
                    similar and a flag is more clear.</p>

                    <!-- Hifi -->
                    <h2>High-Fidelity Prototype</h2>
                    <p>I then thought about colors, font, and text and created a set of high-fidelity prototypes using Figma.</p>

                    <p class="description">Desktop</p>
                    <img class="redesign-img" src="./images/desktop.png" alt="High Fidelity Desktop Prototype">

                    <div class="split-box">
                        <div class="column">
                            <p class="description">Tablet</p>
                            <img src="./images/tablet.png" alt="High Fidelity Tablet Prototype">
                        </div>

                        <div class="column">
                            <p class="description">Mobile</p>
                            <img src="./images/mobile.png" alt="High Fidelity Mobile Prototype">
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <p class="description">Hamburger Menu can be opened on narrow screen like tablet or mobile.</p>
                    <img class="redesign-img" src="./images/tablet-hamburger.png" alt="Hamburger Menu Prototype">

                    <!-- Design Guide -->
                    <h2>Style Guide</h2>

                    <p>I created the following style guide to show the colors and visual interactions of the website</p>

                    <img class="redesign-img" src="./images/styleguide.png" alt="Style Guide">

                    <p>I chose to use orange, white, and grey as the color scheme of the website because I wanted the
                    website to look light and warm. I thought it was important for a manhwa reading website to look
                    warm and welcoming to encourage a good mood for reading, and also be simple and straightforward to
                    help users easily consume the content or access information.</p>

                </div>

                <!-- Responsive Redesign -->
                <div class="section">
                    <h1>Responsive Redesign</h1>

                    <p>Finally, I created a responsive webpage following the hi-fi prototypes and style guide.</p>

                    <a class="weblink" href="./MANHWATOP/home.html">
                    <button>View Project Website</button></a>

                    <p>I thoroughly tested the website on various screen sizes and made sure the layout was still effective on desktop, tablet,
                    and phone. Additionally, I tested 150% font size on Google Chrome and on my Mac settings. I found that large font size caused
                    my full header menu to wrap text strangely, so I adjusted the width at which the website enters tablet mode and shows a
                    hamburger menu instead to fix this. WAVE evaluation did not differ between screen sizes, I had some empty buttons and links on
                    all screen sizes.</p>

                    <p>I learned from this assignment how difficult compelete accessibility is to achieve. Even after many hours of studying the problems
                    the original site had and redesigning it to fix them, I still ended up forgetting some button and link descriptive text. It is seemingly a
                    simple, straightforward step to add alternative text to visual elements, but when there are so many it becomes easy to slip up and forget.
                    I feel that part of this is due to a lack of education on accessibility. In my many years studying computer science, I have never been formally
                    taught how to correctly make buttons and links accessible. Accessibility is extremely imporant, yet is not focused on nearly as in depth as
                    more standard topics like how to code a javascript button or css flexbox.</p>
