					<h1>Introduction</h1>
					<p>The Compliment Hub is a multi-lingual compliment sending website used to research the psychology of giving
						and receiving compliments across different cultures. After sending or receiving a compliment, the user is presented with
						an optional short research survey.</p>
					<p>I worked in a team to develop The Compliment Hub for a client and focused mostly on
						front-end development. The project was created with an HTML and Javascript frontend, and a Node.js and MySQL backend.</p>
					<p>Our work in this project included :</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Working closely with the client to match their vision</li>
						<li>Interviewing users to understand their needs and expectations</li>
						<li>Planning the project front-end and back-end architecture</li>
						<li>Creating user flows to generate a user-centered design</li>
						<li>Developing and deploying the website</li>
						<li>Performance and security testing</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="section">
					<h1>Working with the Client</h1>
					<p>Our client was a postdoctoral research fellow from University of Chicago looking to "investigate the psychology of giving
						and receiving compliments in different cultures."</p>
					<p>RESEARCH QUESTIONS</p>
					<p>Our team met frequently with our client to give updates and refine our work.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="section">
					<h1>Initial Sketches</h1>
					<p>We created initial rough designs of the website. Here are some pages from our initial sketches : </p>
					<div class="grid2">
						<img class="design" src="./images/rough0.png"></img>
						<img class="design" src="./images/rough1.png"></img>
					</div>

				<div class="section">
					<h1>User Interviews</h1>
					<p>We interviewed users to understand their needs and expectations about a compliment sending website. We asked the following
					questions to three users after creating a first design draft :</p>
					<h2>Interview Questions</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>What functionality do you expect from our project?</li>
						<li>What features do you think would be most important out of the ones we have planned? (Email System, Survey, Card System
							Kindness Map, Multilinguality, Sharing on Social Media, Contact Us)</li>
						<li>How intuitive are the current layouts/designs?</li>
					</ul>
					<h2>Response Summary</h2>
					<p>We found that all three users preferred clean and simple UI. One user wanted premade compliment
					templates. The Email System and Card System were thought to be most important, and the Contact Us and Sharing on Social Media
					were thought to be least important. There were mixed responses to our initial design. While all users thought it was
					intuitive and easy to use, one user thought the interface should be more minimalistic and one user noted the layout
					was inconsitent between pages.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="section">
					<h1>User Flows</h1>
					<p>We created the following user flows to help generate a user-centered design and an intuitive website page flow.</p>
					<br>
					<img id="userflow" src="./images/userflow.png"></img>
				</div>
				<div class="section" id="process">
					<h1>Second Design</h1>
					<p>After receiving user feedback and creating user flows, we produced a second design. Here are some pages from our second design :</p>
					<div class="grid2"><img class="design" src="./images/complimentfull.png"></img>
						<div class="grid3">
							<img class="design2" id="second" src="./images/compliment2.png"></img>
							<img class="design2" src="./images/compliment3.png"></img>
						</div>
					</div>
					<p>Ultimately, our client chose to use a design from an outside designer, which we implemented in HTML and CSS.</p>
