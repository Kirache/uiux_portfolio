					<h1>Introduction</h1>
					<p>The Compliment Hub is a multi-lingual compliment sending website used to research the psychology of giving
						and receiving compliments across different cultures. After sending or receiving a compliment, the user is presented with
						an optional short research survey.</p>
					<p>I worked in a team to develop The Compliment Hub for a client and focused mostly on
						front-end development. The project was created with an HTML and Javascript frontend, and a Node.js and MySQL backend.</p>
					<p>Our work in this project included :</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Working closely with the client to match their vision</li>
						<li>Interviewing users to understand their needs and expectations</li>
						<li>Planning the project front-end and back-end architecture</li>
						<li>Creating user flows and scenarios to generate a user-centered design</li>
						<li>Developing and deploying the website</li>
						<li>Performance and security testing</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="section">
					<h1>Working with the Client</h1>
					<p>Our client was a postdoctoral research fellow from University of Chicago looking to "investigate the psychology of giving
						and receiving compliments in different cultures."</p>
					<h2>Primary Research Questions</h2>
					<ol>
						<li>Compliment and happiness: Do compliments make people happy across cultures?</li>
						<li>Undervaluing compliment: Do people across cultures underestimate the positive impact of compliments on their recipients? And overestimate how awkward/embarrassed/shy others will feel when receiving compliments?</li>
					</ol>
					<h2>Secondary Research Questions</h2>
					<ol>
						<li>Frequency of compliment-giving behavior: Do people in all cultures perceive a deficit of compliment-giving (compared to how often you think you should…, how often do you actually…)? How often do people give compliments in different cultures? Is behavior frequency correlated with interpersonal miscalibration?</li>
						<li>What makes a good compliment in the eyes of the expressers and recipients?</li>
						<li>Taxonomy of compliments: What do people find praiseworthy in different cultures? </li>
					</ol>
					<p>Our team met frequently with our client to give updates and refine our work. We worked closely with the client to
					match her vision of the website and best help her achieve her research goal.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="section">
					<h1>Initial Sketches and Scenario</h1>
					<p>We created initial rough designs of the website. Here are some pages from our initial sketches : </p>
					<div class="grid2">
						<img class="design" src="./images/rough0.png"></img>
						<img class="design" src="./images/rough1.png"></img>
					</div>
					<p>We also created a scenario of a user using the website to try to understand how
						a user might interact with the website : </p>
					<p id="scenario">Steven Reiss opens his email and sees that there is a compliment on a very nicely designed front side of a compliment card his friend sent him from The Compliment Hub. Then he clicks on a link, which brings up the website home page and a pop-up window with the compliment card. This makes him happy and he saves the compliment as an image. The pop-up also has a survey asking about how the compliment made Steven feel. He fills out the survey, consents to having the data used for research, submits, and closes the pop-up. Steven decides to send a compliment to his other friend, and clicks to send a compliment on the home page. He picks the theme of fashion for the compliment card and writes a compliment about his friend’s excellent taste in button down shirts. He picks blue as his background color. He completes a survey about how he feels and consents to having this data used for research. He enters in his friend’s email and is taken to a confirmation page which has social media share buttons. He shares the compliment on Facebook and tags his friend, then closes the website. </p>

				</div>
				<div class="section">
					<h1>User Interviews</h1>
					<p>We interviewed users to understand their needs and expectations about a compliment sending website. We asked the following
					questions to three users after creating a first design draft :</p>
					<h2>Interview Questions</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>What functionality do you expect from our project?</li>
						<li>What features do you think would be most important out of the ones we have planned? (Email System, Survey, Card System
							Kindness Map, Multilinguality, Sharing on Social Media, Contact Us)</li>
						<li>How intuitive are the current layouts/designs?</li>
					</ul>
					<h2>Response Summary</h2>
					<p>We found that all three users preferred clean and simple UI. One user wanted premade compliment
					templates. The Email System and Card System were thought to be most important, and the Contact Us and Sharing on Social Media
					were thought to be least important. There were mixed responses to our initial design. While all users thought it was
					intuitive and easy to use, one user thought the interface should be more minimalistic and one user noted the layout
					was inconsitent between pages.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="section">
					<h1>User Flows</h1>
					<p>We created the following user flows to help generate a user-centered design and an intuitive website page flow.</p>
					<br>
					<img id="userflow" src="./images/userflow.png"></img>
				</div>
				<div class="section" id="process">
					<h1>Second Design</h1>
					<p>After receiving user feedback and creating user flows, we produced a second design. Here are some pages from our second design :</p>
					<div class="grid2"><img class="design" src="./images/complimentfull.png"></img>
						<div class="grid3">
							<img class="design2" id="second" src="./images/compliment2.png"></img>
							<img class="design2" src="./images/compliment3.png"></img>
						</div>
					</div>
					<p>Ultimately, our client chose to use a design from an outside designer, which we implemented in HTML and CSS.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="section">
					<h1>Development</h1>
					<p>We developed the website using a HTML and Javascript frontend, and a Node.js and MySQL backend.
					I worked mostly on the frontend, implementing the design given to us and creating the interactive elements,
					while my teammates focused more on the backend and connecting the pieces. We helped each other when necessary
					and worked together well as team, and all contributed to various parts of the project.</p>

					<h1>Performance and Security Testing</h1>
					<p>After creating the website, we performed tests to evaluate usability and security.</p>
					<p>Our project website, The Compliment Hub, is very usability and front-end focused,
						so we prioritized HTML/CSS validation, performance testing, and front-end testing. However,
						because we still used a backend and because we wanted to protect our database and users, we did
						backend and security testing as well.</p>
					<h2>HTML/CSS Validation</h2>
					<p>We used WC3 on many website pages, which uncovered that our website was missing many accessibility elements
						such as lang tags and text alternatives for images. We then added these elements to improve accessibility.
						We also discovered we had invalid tags, which we removed afterwards. </p>
					<h2>Performance Testing</h2>
					<p>We also ran our website’s homepage through GTmetrix, and we received a Pagespeed Score of 98% (A), as well as
						a YSlow Score of 96% (A). This was very positive, and it showed that our group had done a good job with
						performance speed. </p>
					<h2>Frontend Testing </h2>
					<p>We found the edge case of when the user jumps straight to submitting a compliment card without entering any
						information, it leads to our kindness map not loading. We broke down our code into smaller, more manageable
						functions and used gunit testing, and discovered that our problem was that we did not handle invalid or empty
						fields in our kindness map displaying algorithm. We added checks into our code, and also made it so the user
						cannot submit a compliment without entering at least the very basic information.</p>
					<h2>Backend Testing</h2>
					<p>We wrote a basic backend testing suite with Jasmine, and with it, discovered that our routing for the contact
						selectively worked; it did not work when going from any page other than the home page because it was a href on
						the homepage. This was an edge case, and we fixed this with a response.redirect to home.html. It also discovered
						that the algorithm on the backend for computing “kindness chains” returned true in the test case when it should
						have returned false, leading us to fix that bug as well. </p>
					<h2>Security Testing</h2>
					<p>To test this, we manually tried some common attacks such as JS injections, SQL injections, and Cross-Site scripting.
						We discovered that we were vulnerable to injection attacks, so we made our application more robust by validating user
						inputs on the server side before executing functions requiring those inputs. This protects it from most injection
						attacks as opposed to more specific threats. </p>

					<h1>Takeaways</h1>
					<p>I learned a lot throughout this project about interacting with a client, designing for usability, website code
					development, and security.</p>
